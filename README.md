## Premise

- It's okay to submit an incomplete project within the given time.
- Bonus tasks are welcomed but not necessary for the completion of the challenge.
- The challenge is focused on code quality aspects such as consistency, modularity, performance, and error handling.

## Task Description

Your task is to create a full-stack web application for managing tasks. The application should allow users to perform the following actions:

- Create a new task through an API endpoint.
- Update an existing task through an API endpoint.
- Delete a task through an API endpoint.
- Retrieve a list of tasks through an API endpoint.
- Implement user authentication and authorization for accessing the API endpoints.
- Develop a secure API that protects against common web application attacks.

On the frontend, the application should provide the following features:

- A form for creating a new task.
- A table for displaying a list of tasks.
- The ability to edit or delete tasks from the table.
- A search feature to search for tasks by keyword.
- The ability to filter tasks by status or priority.
- Pagination for the table of tasks.

The application should use a MongoDB database to store the tasks.

## Technical Requirements

To fulfill the task, please ensure the following technical requirements are met:

- Use Node.js and Express to create the backend API endpoints.
- Use React to create the frontend.
- Use MongoDB to store the tasks.
- Implement pagination for the task table.
- Utilize a secure authentication and authorization method, such as JSON Web Tokens (JWT) or OAuth 2.0.
- Implement secure coding practices and protect against common web application attacks, such as cross-site scripting (XSS) and SQL injection.
- Use Git for version control and commit your changes to a public repository on GitHub.

## Bonus Features

Feel free to implement any of the following bonus features, although they are not necessary for completing the challenge:

- Add the ability to assign tasks to different users.
- Implement email notifications when a task is assigned or completed.
- Add the ability to attach files to tasks.
- Implement real-time updates using WebSockets.

## Evaluation Criteria
